> **Why this is different**  
> Instead of squeezing more adaptation out of a fixed architecture, GrowNet uses a principled rule to **add structure** when data is novel. That means the model’s capacity grows only when the expected benefit of specialization beats further adaptation. Growth events are logged, measurable, and reversible.
