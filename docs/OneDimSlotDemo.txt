Java 1D Slot Formation Demo â€” Notes

File:
- JavaProject/GrowNet/src/main/java/ai/nektron/grownet/demo/OneDimSlotDemo.java

Behavior:
- Builds a Region with a single excitatory neuron layer.
- Binds scalar input port "x" to that layer.
- Drives values [100.0, 110.0, 120.0, 130.0, 140.0].
  With FIRST anchor and 10% bin width, this creates five slots (bins 0..4).
- Prints per-tick metrics and final slot count + slot IDs.

Suggested breakpoints (step-through debugging):
- Region.tick(...)                  // drive scalar into edge and route
- Layer.forward(...)                // fan into neurons for this tick
- Neuron.onInput(...)               // slot selection + local learning
- SlotEngine.selectOrCreateSlot(...)// bin computation + strict capacity fallback

Notes:
- src/java is a symlink to JavaProject, so this demo is visible in your IDE under:
  src/java/ai/nektron/grownet/demo/OneDimSlotDemo.java
- JavaProject is ignored by git per repo settings; this demo is for local debugging.
