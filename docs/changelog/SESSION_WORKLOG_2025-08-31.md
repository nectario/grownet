# Session Worklog — 2025-08-31

Summary of changes, rationale, and how to run checks. This log is intended as a handoff to continue in the next session.

## Major outcomes

- Authored overview: `What_this_codebase_is_about.md` (root) explaining GrowNet goals, architecture, V4 temporal focus, ports-as-edges, and parity.
- Fixed Python test suite and added a compatibility path for legacy deliveredEvents accounting.
- Standardized variable names (descriptive, not 1–2 char) across Python, C++, Mojo, and Java (kept `i/j` loop indices).
- Added concise comments/docstrings across languages to clarify intent at key seams (Region tick semantics, SlotEngine anchor logic, Weight thresholding, input/output layers).
- Documented testing behavior in `docs/TESTING.md` and added `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md` comment style guide.

## Python changes (tests now 10/10)

- tests bootstrap: `src/python/tests/conftest.py` ensures both repo root and `src/python` on `sys.path`.
- metrics aliases: `src/python/metrics.py` keeps snake_case and camelCase fields in sync.
- removed `slots()` vs `slots` collision: use dict attribute everywhere.
- bus setters + hooks: canonical `set_inhibition/set_modulation` with compat aliases; `fire_hooks` used consistently.
- ports-as-edges kept: `Region.tick/tick_2d` drive the edge once. Compatibility shim for deliveredEvents with env flag:
  - `GROWNET_COMPAT_DELIVERED_COUNT=bound` counts bound layers without double-driving.
  - Scoped fixture added and used only in the one test that needed bound-layer accounting.
- demos cleanup: fixed snake_case and minor typos (e.g., `add_input_layer_2d`).

## Cross-language refactor (readability)

- Python: descriptive variable names throughout core and demos.
- C++: renamed short variables/parameters; clarified helper names in Region/Input/OutputLayer2D/InputLayerND; non-functional comments added near tick/thresholding.
- Mojo: renamed short locals; clarified synapse weight field; comments on tick and image forward.
- Java (JavaProject/GrowNet): descriptive renames in Tract/Region/Layer/Input/OutputLayer2D/SlotEngine/Neuron; tiny test comment to state edge-only assumption in one suite.

## Docs added/updated

- `docs/TESTING.md`: explains deliveredEvents accounting and the test fixture approach.
- `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md`: short comment style guide.
- `What_this_codebase_is_about.md` (root): overview of the codebase (architecture, semantics, parity).

## How to run

- Python unit tests:
  - Default (edge-only accounting): `pytest -q` → expected: 10 passed
  - Legacy bound-layer count (if needed): `GROWNET_COMPAT_DELIVERED_COUNT=bound pytest -q`

## Follow-ups (optional)

- Consider aligning Java/C++ test runners with the Python env-flag approach if you want to toggle deliveredEvents accounting across languages for parity experiments.
- If you want clearer public API docs in Java/C++ headers, we can add brief Javadoc/Doxygen blocks mirroring the Python docstrings.

Commits (high-level)

- tests(py): add compat fixture for deliveredEvents; align metrics aliases; remove slots() vs slots collision; bus setter aliases; input binding shim; minor API polish
- docs(testing): document deliveredEvents env flag; demos(py): fix snake_case and typos; Python: no remaining slots() callsites
- refactor(py): rename 1–2 char variables to descriptive names across core modules and demos; no API changes
- refactor(cpp,mojo): rename 1–2 char variables and params to descriptive names (keep i/j loops); no behavioral changes
- refactor(java): rename 1–2 char variables to descriptive names across core classes; no behavior change
- docs(code): add concise comments/docstrings across languages for clarity
